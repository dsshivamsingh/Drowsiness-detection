# Drowsiness-detection
This repository contains a comprehensive Drowsiness Detection System designed to improve road safety by monitoring drivers for signs of fatigue. Leveraging advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques, this system can accurately detect and alert drivers when they show signs of drowsiness.
# Features
Real-time Detection: Utilizes a webcam to continuously monitor the driver's facial features.
Eye State Analysis: Analyzes the driver's eye state (open or closed) to determine drowsiness levels.
Yawning Detection: Identifies yawning patterns as an indicator of fatigue.
Alert System: Provides audio and visual alerts to warn drivers when drowsiness is detected.
Customizable Sensitivity: Allows customization of detection sensitivity to reduce false positives.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Designed to run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
# Technologies Used
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
Dlib: For facial landmark detection.
TensorFlow/Keras: For implementing machine learning models.
Python: The core programming language for the system.
# Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/dsshivamsingh/drowsiness-detection.git
cd drowsiness-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
Run the main script to start the drowsiness detection system:
python main.py
Ensure your webcam is connected and properly configured. The system will begin monitoring and provide alerts as needed.
